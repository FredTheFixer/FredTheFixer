- 👋 Hi, I’m @FredTheFixer, I'm a learning self taught developer. Starting with HTML/CSS and currently working on teaching myself JavaScript.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning as much as I can about coding and working my way up towards eventually getting a job as a junior developer. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any forms of projects where I can learn and gain experience. 
- 📫 Reach me through Github or through my Linkedln @richterfreddy
